\begin{abstract}
The use of procedural content generation (PCG) is not un-common amongst games, it appears in many applications. PCG algorithms notably present the advantage of providing potentially infinite and un-predictable content for the players, which can significantly add value to the game. However, implementing a good PCG algorithm that generates convincing results is not a trivial task. PCG revolves around the concept of randomness that is usually implemented by using pseudo-random number generators. Different PCG methods can be used to create content for specific kinds of environments. These methods can vary greatly depending on the type of environment desired. This thesis focuses on generating content for dungeon-like or maze-like environments by identifying the most suitable methods and algorithms. The methods used for generating maze involve finding a random spanning tree of a graph, hence the Prim's and Kruskal's algorithms can be used. Further on, we can obtain a dungeon-like environment from a maze by applying modifications to it such as adding loops and rooms.
